# tic-tac-toe-game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The objective is to place three identical marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a 3x3 grid. The game can be played in two modes: single-player against an AI or two-player locally, making it a fun and interactive experience.
